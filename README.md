This repository contains implementations of molecular simulation algorithms in Python. In the near future, I also aim to implement some of these algorithms parallely using MPI/C.

Caution: Work in progress!

# Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulations for hard-sphere systems
- The folder `hard_spheres` contains Python implementations of MCMC algorithms for the Canonical (NVT) ensemble, and for the Grand Canonical (mu,V,T) ensemble, for hard sphere systems.
